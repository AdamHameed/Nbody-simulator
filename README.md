# Nbody-simulator
a program which simulates planet trajectories using differential equations. The user can choose different numerical solvers to see how their performance compares.

n-body-simulation contains a Next.Js prject done in typescript for better performance. However for more lightweight usage one can just use true_bodies.html for a good enough understanding of the project and how the solvers work.
